        <p class="about-me">Hey! <br>My name is Thiely Gimenez, I'm from Brazil and I'm studying Computer Programming at Humber College in
            Toronto. <br> I just arrived in Canada with my husband a few months ago. We have always wanted to live abroad and we are living our dream now. In the left side you can see a picture of us in Niagara Falls.<br>I already have a Bsc in Production Engineering and three years of experience in supply chain. <br>I always thought about going into the IT world and I even took some programming courses before coming to
            Humber. Now, I'm currently enrolled in the following subjects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Algorithms and Problem Solving;</li>
                <li>Database Concepts &amp; Design;</li>
                <li>Fundamentals of Numeric Computing;</li>
                <li>Operating Systems;</li>
